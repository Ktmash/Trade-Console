    "notes": "DAY NUMBER ONE BAAAAABBBYYYYYYY: Took my first trade on the Eval today. We had some decent price action pre market open, 3-6 hundred contracts per 1 minute candle. Took the short off the midpoint, Ran down just about to TP, We quickly reversed back up past the midpoint and touched my SL. I am mad because I listened to AI and allowed to scare me and set my SL lower than what my Strategy says to do. I would have hit all targets perfectly had i followed the 12 point SL target instead of Ai's suggestion of 1% of my 2k draw down limit.",
