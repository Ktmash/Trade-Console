I went ahead and jumped in for 3 shorts. This was very dangerous it seems due to volatility i had my stop loss way up in the orb incase we had to test it again to drop lower, Which we did. I went HEAVY into Drawdown but stayed disciplined and the trade reversed back down and worked out in my favor. I found another low we started to stall out aroun dso i clipped on contract off and waited to see but we kept retesting so i set my Stop loss to that point and it got tested again and price went back up to the upside.",

    "notes": "Day Three!!!! We finally have a win, Today i waited until NY open to wait for a better confirmation. Entered a few points above the mid point which seemed needed but it actually wasn't. We tested the midpoint wicked down twice but never closed below. Once again my SL discipline hurt me, I lost on a good bit of profit on two contracts because i moved my SL and a random wick came and knocked me out while the market is still pumping up. I made a pretty big mistake by allowing my SL to sell a third contract that i did not actually have so we lost almost 20$ on that mistake.",

Saw a Retest at like 6:30AM, I think the main failure point on this trade was some unknown news over the weekend about a US > Venezuela Bombing. I sized up to the Eval Position size of 3 contracts. Got stopped out at my 12 point loss. Going forward for all Monday Trades i need to review the weekend news Sunday night, Baby girls idea. Wondering if i need to wait until a little closer to new york open to jump in instead of so early. Hard to tell what's enough volume to get in before NY open.",

Took the short off the midpoint, Ran down just about to TP, We quickly reversed back up past the midpoint and touched my SL. I am mad because I listened to AI and allowed to scare me and set my SL lower than what my Strategy says to do. I would have hit all targets perfectly had i followed the 12 point SL target instead of Ai's suggestion of 1% of my 2k draw down limit.",
