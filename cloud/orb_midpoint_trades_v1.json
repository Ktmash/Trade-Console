    "notes": "Day Number two!!! Trying to keep the hype up. Saw a Retest at like 6:30AM, I think the main failure point on this trade was some unknown news over the weekend about a US > Venezuela Bombing. I sized up to the Eval Position size of 3 contracts. Got stopped out at my 12 point loss. Going forward for all Monday Trades i need to review the weekend news Sunday night, Baby girls idea. Wondering if i need to wait until a little closer to new york open to jump in instead of so early. Hard to tell what's enough volume to get in before NY open.",

    "notes": "DAY NUMBER ONE BAAAAABBBYYYYYYY: Took my first trade on the Eval today. We had some decent price action pre market open, 3-6 hundred contracts per 1 minute candle. Took the short off the midpoint, Ran down just about to TP, We quickly reversed back up past the midpoint and touched my SL. I am mad because I listened to AI and allowed to scare me and set my SL lower than what my Strategy says to do. I would have hit all targets perfectly had i followed the 12 point SL target instead of Ai's suggestion of 1% of my 2k draw down limit.",
