Today we had a decent amount of news, We blew up past the ORB before NY open, We eventually retraced back down and respected the orb multiple times so i went ahead and put a small risk 3 contract in, risked 20 dollars per contract. We went back up close to session highs and i actually meant to clip off one contract but i sold all 3 for a decent profit, Happy accident i wanted to be out of this all together by 8am for the News anyways! Look for smaller opportunities dude, We don't have to go for hundreds of dollars per contract. Arguably we could have left the small 60 dollar stop loss and let it ride a little higher but for a news day i am happy.",

Es did some very bad and choppy price action dropping all the way past the orb close to my 12 point stop and would retrace back up to around 15 points above. I tried to be paitent and see if we could do a little better but after we retraced to my mid point again and stalled out again 15 points up i clipped on contract off while in a meeting at work waited a little longer and basically the same thing happened again so i clipped the last two contracts off securing a win.
